# RFCs

If you have an idea for something not currently covered by this repo, please first [open an issue][open-an-issue] describing what you’d like to see encouraged/avoided.
Then, after suitable discussion, if the RFC is accepted, a PR can then be opened.
At this point, either you, or one of our core contributors can write up the proposal.
Before being merged, this PR must be approved by you and our core contributors (of course, self-approvals don’t count :) ).

Proposal PRs must include links to the relevant issue.

# Fixes

If you see any typos, grammatical mistakes or the like, please do open a PR!
Such mistakes distract the reader from the core message of this repo, hence any fix, no matter how small, is greatly appreciated.

# Feedback

Notes and feedback give vital extra perspective which helps improve documents such as these.
To provide your feedback, please [open an issue][open-an-issue].
Please make sure to provide permalinks to any sections being discussed as this keeps the paper trail tidy for future readers.
